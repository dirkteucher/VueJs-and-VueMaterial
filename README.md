# vuegallery

> Just throwing together some of the Vue Material elements and testing out the VueJS routing to see how it all works and seeing where it's limitations are. For example. Bootstrap 3 will integrate quite nicely out the box but does interfere with the Vue Material header and side navs rendering those components inoperable (without x hours of customisation).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout  [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vue Material](https://vuematerial.github.io/#/).
